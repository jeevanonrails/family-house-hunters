## **1. Paint**

The quickest and most inexpensive change you can make to your home’s interior design is new paint. Whether you decide to paint entire rooms or just create an accent wall, new color on the walls will create instant glamour.

If you hire a pro to do the job, plan on spending between $380 and $790 for a 10X12 room, according to homeadvisor.com. This is labor only, by the way, and doesn’t include ceilings, trim or cost of the paint.”

Do it yourself and you’ll save big.

## **2. Rearrange what you have**

Are you taking advantage of the focal point in each room? Whether it’s the fireplace or a view outside a window, arrange furniture so that it faces the focal point.

Not sure what qualifies as a room’s focal point? Check out the guide at [pellabranch.com](https://www.pellabranch.com/blog/global-blogs/how-to-define-a-focal-point/).

Try switching up furniture from one room and putting it in another. Sometimes a stylish nightstand makes a great end-table in the living room; or try putting a dresser in the dining room to act as a buffet.

If you need new furniture but the price just isn’t in your budget, think about slipcovering what you already have. Or, buy inexpensive used furniture and put your DIY skills to work.

While shopping for used furniture, don’t overlook [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/) online. You can find almost anything there and sellers are likely to negotiate on prices.

## **3. Add Color**

New throw pillows, window coverings and rugs are not only great ways to freshen a room but add color as well. The color-of-the-year, by the way is purple, so go on trend by adding pops of it in your accessories. See the shade (Ultra Violet) on [pantone’s website](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/07/569153010/purple-is-the-color-of-the-year-for-2018).

Flowers and plants add a splash of color to any room, be it a huge bouquet in the entry or small nosegays in the bathrooms. If you lack a green thumb, silk flowers and plants are inexpensive alternatives.

## **4. Accessories**

You don’t need to break the bank when shopping for accessory pieces and accents for your interior design project. If you find you need a few more accessories why not try flea markets and garage sales? Here’s what to keep an eye out for:

* Mirrors will make any room look larger and lighter. Groupings of mirrors can be an even more dramatic way to open up a room.
* Art work is another way to add color and interest as well as texture to your interior design.
* Decorative pillows can be used in bedrooms and living rooms.
* Look for items such as decorative plates to hang on the kitchen walls, vases, baskets, candle holders and sconces. Other fun things you might want to look for are drawer pulls and handles for your kitchen and bathroom cabinetry.

If you have the budget, by all means, hire a professional to give you some interior decorating ideas. If not, with a little effort you can do it yourself and save some money. Visit [pinterest.com](https://www.pinterest.com/diyboards/diy-home-decor/?lp=true) to find fellow DIYers and get tips.
